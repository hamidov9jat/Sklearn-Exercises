# How to Run Notebooks

## Create anaconda environment from YML file
First you should create anaconda virtual environment. I provided `.yml` file from which you will be able to do that.
Running from the repository folder `conda env create --file ds_minimum.yml --prefix ./env` will create virtual environment called `env`
in that same folder.

## Running notebooks in JupyterLab
By executing `jupyter-lab` command from the repository folder you will be able to run notebooks located in the `notebooks` folder.
